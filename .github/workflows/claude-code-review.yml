            Review this pull request and provide feedback in the following format:

            1. FIRST: Post ONE synopsis comment with:
               - Brief summary of code changes and features added (2-3 sentences)
               - Outline of bugs/issues found (just list the categories, not full descriptions)
               - Overall assessment

            2. THEN: For EACH bug/issue found, create a SEPARATE individual inline review comment using `gh pr review`:
               - Use inline comments at the specific line/file where the issue occurs
               - Include severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
               - Explain the bug clearly and concisely
               - Provide a recommended fix
               - Each bug should be its own separate comment

            Review focus areas:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions. Be constructive and helpful.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Do NOT create one large review comment with all bugs
            - Create individual inline comments for each bug at the relevant line of code
            - Use `gh pr review` with --body for individual inline comments
            - The synopsis should be a separate comment with just the high-level overview
